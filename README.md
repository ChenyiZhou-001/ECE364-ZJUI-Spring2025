# ECE364 Final Project: Programming Methods for Machine Learning

Welcome to the final project for **ECE364: Programming Methods for Machine Learning**. This project allows you to apply the machine learning (ML) methods and programming skills you've acquired throughout the course. You may choose from multiple project options, each involving a different type of ML problem and dataset.

## ðŸ’¡ Project Options

You must select **one** of the following project options:

### ðŸ”¢ **Track 1: Cat & Dog Breed Classification**: 
- Fine-grained classification using the Pet Dataset.
### ðŸ”¢ **Track 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors**:
- Gesture recognition using a real-world hand gesture image dataset.
### ðŸ“„ **Track 3: Fake News Detection**:
- Binary classification to identify fake vs. real news using text and titles.
### ðŸ“„ **Track 4: Legal Entailment Prediction**:
- Sentence-pair classification using court case contexts and legal holdings.
### ðŸ“ˆ **Track 5: PM2.5 Air Quality Prediction**:
- Forecast hourly PM2.5 levels based on weather and pollution data.
### ðŸ“ˆ **Track 6: Traffic Volume Forecasting**:
- Predict hourly traffic volume using weather and time-based features.

## ðŸ“¦ Submission Checklist

For your selected project, submit a `.zip` file containing:

1. Source code for training, evaluation, and prediction
2. `prediction.csv` file in the required format
3. A `README.md` with setup and run instructions
4. A **2-page PDF report** summarizing:
