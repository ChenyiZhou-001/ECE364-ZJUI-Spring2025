# ECE364 Final Project: Programming Methods for Machine Learning

Welcome to the final project for **ECE364: Programming Methods for Machine Learning**. This project allows you to apply the machine learning (ML) methods and programming skills you've acquired throughout the course. You may choose from multiple project options, each involving a different type of ML problem and dataset.

## 💡 Project Options

You must select **one** of the following project options:

### 🔢 Option 1: Image Classification Tasks
- **Cat & Dog Breed Classification**: Fine-grained classification using the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset.
- **Rock, Paper, Scissors**: Gesture recognition using a real-world hand gesture image dataset.

### 📄 Option 2: Text Classification Tasks
- **Fake News Detection**: Binary classification to identify fake vs. real news using text and titles.
- **Legal Entailment Prediction**: Sentence-pair classification using court case contexts and legal holdings.

### 📈 Option 3: Time Series Forecasting Tasks
- **PM2.5 Air Quality Prediction**: Forecast hourly PM2.5 levels based on weather and pollution data.
- **Traffic Volume Forecasting**: Predict hourly traffic volume using weather and time-based features.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each project folder contains:
- `task_description.md`: Detailed task introduction and requirements
- Starter code or data access instructions (if applicable)
- Submission templates and evaluation format

## 🧑‍💻 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries: See individual project folders (commonly used: PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas)
- Each model must adhere to specified **parameter limits**
- Use only the allowed frameworks as specified in each task

## 📦 Submission Checklist

For your selected project, submit a `.zip` file containing:

1. Source code for training, evaluation, and prediction
2. `prediction.csv` file in the required format
3. A `README.md` with setup and run instructions
4. A **2-page PDF report** summarizing:
   - Model architecture and training setup
   - Preprocessing and feature engineering
   - Final results and performance metrics
   - Error analysis or visualization (optional but encouraged)

## 📅 Deadline and Grading

- **Submission Deadline**: One month (From XXXX to XXXX)
- **Grading**: Based on correctness, code quality, documentation, and insights in your report
